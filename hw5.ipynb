    "Hint: [this stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49531655/issue-using-qualitative-brewer-palettes-in-plotnine) discussion might come in handy to set the palette colors. Also, note that the variable `clarity` is actually an ordered categorical variable (to see this, read the docs in R for the `diamonds` dataset with `? diamonds`). We can create a `pandas` equivalent of an R factor by using the `pandas.Categorical` class (see the docs [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Categorical.html)). To get the same ordering that we got in R for the dodged bars, you will need to transform the `clarity` variable in the `diamonds` dataset that you read with `pandas` to a `pandas.Categorical` variable."
