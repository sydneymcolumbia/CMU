    "Re-implement the `ip_address2country_code` function of Homework 4 in Python. Show that your implementation works by executing your function using the following list of IP addresses as input:\n",

    "[\n",
    "    \"171.182.200.160\",\n",
    "    \"203.45.67.89\",\n",

    "- You will need the [`requests` library](https://requests.readthedocs.io), and in particular you will need to use [the `requests.post` function](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/#requests.post).\n",
    "- You can use a list comprehension to create the request body (which you will pass to the `json` argument of the `request.post` function). According to [the ip-api API documentation](https://ip-api.com/docs/api:batch), it is acceptable to format the request body as a list of dictionaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  [\n",
    "      {\"query\": \"171.182.200.160\"},\n",
    "      {\"query\": \"203.45.67.89\"},\n",
    "      ...\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can parse the body of the response using the `json` method e.g.,\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  response = requests.post(...)\n",
    "  response.json() # <- this is a list of dictionaries, with a dictionary for each input ip address\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, you can use another list comprehension on the output of `response.json()` to create the output list of country codes, but be careful handling cases where the `countryCode` key is not available (e.g., because the IP address is private). You might find it convenient to use the [`get` method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get) of Python dictionaries, which allows to extract the value associated with a key when the key exists and return `None` when the key does not exist."
